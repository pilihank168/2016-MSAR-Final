function pitch = freq2pitch(freq)
% freq2pitch: Frequency (in Hertz) to pitch (in semitones) conversion. [由頻率（以Hertz為單位）至音高（以Semitone為單位）的轉換]
%	Usage: pitch = freq2pitch(freq)
%		freq: frequency vector
%		pitch: pitch vector
%		(Elements of zero are considered as silence and thus not converted.)
